react js
--------


agenda
1. pre-requisite for react
2. what is react.
3. purpose of react.
4. why react


1.pre-requisite to learn react

html: elements,tags,attributes.
css: general properties,selectors,flex(optional),gird(optional)
javascript: variables,datatypes,functions,operators,control statements,
object,array,dom and dom manipulation,events.
advance javascript: es6,promises,oops,let var const,
module scope,closures


2.what is react or react js
react js is javascript library, not a framework.
library- collection of pre-defined functions ,classes or objects which are developed in js.

3.purpose of react js or react
react js is used to create user interface. we can not create frontend application with react.
ui is one of part of frontend application. ex- validation,sending req to server, data management.so some other libraries we need to complete frontend application.ex:redux,axios,reactrouter.

react--> user interface->+other libraries-->frontend application-->frontend engineer

**lot of demands

4.why react to develop user interface.

html -> user interface we can develop
js -> user interface we can develop

why in react---?



----------------------------------------------------------------------



user interface- collection of ui components (ex:button,text,heading..) which user can see and interact with.


create ui in html and js

create a simple button using js- predefined objects and functions, using this we can create dom button elements.then add to dom.

1. in html ..we can not reuse (user interface) list  items or any other block of design or components.simple code.
2. in javascript ..we put all dom list into one function..we can call and reuse it. js long code

in react.
--------

take advantages of html and javascript..leave drawbacks of it.
1. creating ui is simple
2. we can re-use the ui



create button in react
----------------------

1. create html file
2. add basic code of html.
3. script tag of html,write react code
4. integrate react to html.

5. create js file and created functions and classes.


jsx
----

jsx element-->babel compiler-->react element(complex to create)-->react dom-->dom-->ui

-------------------------------------------------------
default width and height of div:
width:100%;
height: auto; depends on child



-we create react ui inside javascript function because of reuse and to pass dynamic data.

-functional component->js function which start with uppercase name and return jsx ui .

-functional component
-class component(not recommended) - nobody use in industries right now.react itself recommended to use functional components.
because simple and fast in execution.

-components represents view on the screen.

-react application will be collection of components.
